####  What are you most proud of as a front-end developer?
To me, I think of the most important skills a front end developer should have, is the ability to think like the `users` and use the application like they would. Looking back at my previous engagements, one of the most important accomplishments was when I improved the UX of an edtech product, I made it easier to use and used all the available design principles I knew of at the time to draw user's attention to important details. This lead to over 40% increase in recurring users. Of course, there are more tech heavy things I have done, but to me, being able to provide value by forcing myself to think like the users and improving the product for them is what I am most proud of.
	
#### What do you enjoy most working as a front-end developer?
As a frontend developer, I believe I have the ability to make or break the product. One of the most enjoyable thing about my work is when I am working on a new design experience for the users. I enjoy crafting beautiful design experiences that would lead to happier users and growth of the company / product.

#### What is your favorite software development principle(s) and/or design pattern(s)?
My favourite software development principle is of course `SOLID`, `YAGNI` and most recently, `Simplicity Driven Development`. It is very easy to fall into a trap of making things too complicated, either because you think you will need it in future (YAGNI). One principle that has helped me write better code, is the SOLID principle, it helps me reason about design and modularity, in such a way that components of the codebase are made simple and not intertwined (Simplicity Driven Development)

#### What is the top 1 (or up to 3) accomplishments you achieved in your previous company?
-Integrated multi-node video streaming feature on a frontend application for an edtech product.
- Worked on a new design/user experience that lead to over 40% increase in recurring users.
- Lead the development and architecture design of a data intensive application (both frontend and backend)


#### How do you like TDD?
At my previous engagments, I have always advocated for TDD. Of course it didn't start out that way. Early on in my career, I used to hate TDD, to me it was a waste of time and resources, but overtime, after working on many software projects and with many teams, I have come to realize that TDD should be an essential part of software development. 

TDD has saved me time, energy and my sanity many times in my career so far. A good implementation of TDD in the development process, will help teams catch bugs faster, maintain quality codebase and help them ship products with peace of mind. I could talk for hours on why TDD should be implemented, but overral, good test coverages leads to stable products and we as engineers should always strive for that.
